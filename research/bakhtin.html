Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin (1895-1975) was a Russian philosopher, literary critic, and semiotician. He is known for his influential contributions to literary theory, linguistics, and cultural studies. Bakhtin's work centers around the concept of dialogism and the study of discourse and language in social contexts.

One of Bakhtin's notable concepts is "dialogism," which emphasizes the interactive and dynamic nature of language and communication. He argued that meaning is not fixed or determined by an individual but emerges through the interplay of multiple voices and perspectives within a social and cultural context.

Bakhtin also introduced the concept of "carnival" or "carnivalesque," which refers to a mode of cultural expression characterized by laughter, parody, and the overturning of social hierarchies. This concept explores the subversive potential of festive and humorous forms of expression in challenging dominant structures and fostering alternative perspectives.

His works, including "Rabelais and His World" and "The Dialogic Imagination," have had a significant impact on fields such as literary criticism, cultural studies, and discourse analysis. Bakhtin's ideas continue to be influential in understanding the complexities of language, literature, and culture within social and historical contexts.
